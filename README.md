# My Portfolio

Developed using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) - Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps

Using Gatsby gave me a great introduction into [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - GraphQL is a query language that allows me to easily fetch my project data. I can now easily update my projects as I go by simply adding newproject.md to my projects folder. 


For Styling I used a mixture of [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
